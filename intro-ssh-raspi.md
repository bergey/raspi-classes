# Getting Started with Python on the Raspberry Pi

1. Open `Terminal`.  You can find it in the folder `Applications/Utilities` (That's means the `Utilities` folder is inside the `Applications` folder.)

2. In `Terminal`, type `ssh %user%@raspi0` and press return.  `ssh` will prompt for a password.  Answer with `%user%`.

3. Now you are connected to the Raspberry Pi.  Type `python` at the prompt, and press return.

4. Now you are connected to Python.  It should print a few lines saying so, and then a new prompt like `>>>`.  Try using Python as a calculator.  Type `2+2` and press return.

5.  On your Mac, start a web browser, and go to inventwithpython.org.  Go to Chapter 2, and read about more ways to use Python.
